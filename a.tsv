Drew pictures and printed out info to explain.     Collaboration worked well for me."Asked specific questions about other things allergies specifically, but not meds.     Asked if I lived with someone.     Asked about PAP and boyfriend.""Drew pictures and printed documents very thorough understanding.    Recommended different drug than Flovent, but with the same purpose.    Said not yet to steroids, talked about them.    Talked about spacer but said i didn't need it.""Printed out a plan that he filled in blanks on a created one specifically for me, written down"Gave me so much informationPlan written down.All because of Dr. Bhatraju! He really made the standard steps his own. Very personable. He even told me what to ask of the pharmacist if I wasn't given detailed directions on use.Appointment was very educational. He did a great job of explaining everything!:  -What's asthma?  -What's happening to me?  -What meds do I need?  -What do they do?  -How do they do that?  -How to use them?  -What steps to take next?  -and more	5

It was such an awkward and uncomfortable moment."				2	undefined"From the beginning of the encounter, the physician set up a space that was far from collaborative and didn't actually treat me like an individual. As he washed his hands he explained that since it was my first visit he likes to ask certain questions first before following up on why I came in to the clinic in the first place. So this hunt and peck/closed end/non-narrative inspiring relationship was established and maintained throughout the entire visit."He did not inquire about my latest results."There was no narrative flow. He did not get a full picture of my asthma history or of me as a patient making it hard to have grave confidence in his assessments and recommendations. For example, he never asked me what I experience when having an asthmatic exacerbation or what they did for me in the emergency room.""He repeated on several occasions, as though he wasn't even convinced that the course he recommended would actually address the issue, that if I feel again the symptoms that I recognized as requiring me to go to the ED before that I should go to the ED."	7

Within in the first 3-4 minutes of our encounter he was basically already making medicine recommendations.He repeated on several occasions that 'asthma sucks' which seemed to be his way of demonstrating some empathy.He did a tremendous job of engaging me as the patient despite the great lack of information gathering. Particularly in sharing the asthma assessment chart that we basically worked through together and his explanation of the nee for an asthma action plan that incorporated my boyfriend.The encounter felt very rushed.He incorrectly demonstrated using the peak flow meter and therefore got inaccurate values from my use.	5

I didn't get a physical check-up, we went straight from history gathering to recommending the Flovent based off what I described and then her checking in with her PRE."Well she fully explained follow-up n' navigation by directed me to get further info from the front desk.I felt very comfortable with the time flow - but found it odd she didn't give me a physical exam.She was very kind and reassuring.She came up with the right diagnosis - and the clinic ran smoothly. My doctor and PCA were friendly and professional.I think she was great minus the non-checkup - but I like that it made me feel she was just very confident based of the history gathering of what I needed.	23
