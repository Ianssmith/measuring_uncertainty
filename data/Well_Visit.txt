Regarding smoking cessation, she did not address it until after PRE. She began the discussion by saying, 'Here they're big on smoking cessation,' which I don't think sends the right message. So I guessed that Dr. Moore stressed that she should do it. Once she got going she didn't do it badly, though, and in this part of the encounter she was more personal and I felt we had more of a rapport.

"I felt the doctor was personable and empathetic. She suggested that I consider quitting, saying it was the best thing I could do for my health at present. She mentioned resources and made herself available. But she didn't explore smoking in the context of my life, so her advice felt a bit general and hands-off. If she had encouraged me to talk about the pros anad cons I would have been more interested in a real discussion of smoking; I would possibly have felt more understood and tended to and I would possibly haved moved into a contemplative stage. In other words, the doctor could have been more aggressive. Today I felt that she left it up to me to take the initiative without really stimulating or persuading me enough to do so.    Separately, she showed a slight tendency to make assumptions during the history gathering, instead of eliciting the specifics of my case i.e. she assumed that my dad died of his heart attack and that I'd never quit smoking previous. I corrected her of course.    These are suggestions for improvement. In general, I felt well-cared for."	1		0

The young woman, asked 'How can I help you?' and she did so while leaning back on the chair, with a look and attitude that said that she would rather be anywhere else on the planet but there.     She took the SP's clinic card and when things seemed unusual to her on her computer screen, she leaned back and called for Tanisha (Mcintosh) who was busy with two other staff persons. After three attempts to get Tanisha's attention, a male nurse, named Jerry, approached and offered to help. He took the clinic card from her and walked to the other side of the counter - inside the door - and looked for the patient's information under Dr. Lan's schedule. He informed the SP that his appointment was for this morning. The SP responded that his appointment was for  1:00 pm.   At this point Jerry returned the clinic card to the original staff person and she used 'an old fashioned credit card swiper type of machine' to swipe the card info onto the  stay healthy form. At this time Tanisha came forward and asked if she could help me, but apparently she had already cleared things up with Jerry, so she was pleased to have 'already helped' the SP. This was a nice moment of levity and human interaction.   The original staff person (the one who seemed to not want to be there), then directed the SP to desk 2C for registration.     When the SP arrived at 2C there was only one staff person at that desk, and she was on the phone on what seemed to be a personal call of vital importance. The call must have been important because the staff person, handled the business of three patients who were in line ahead of the SP, without hanging up, and barely speaking to them. There was lots of hand gestures pointing the patients to other desks. When it was the SP's turn, the staff person took his clinic card and stay healthy form, while still on the phone, and did some typing into the computer, printed a piece of paper, and handed the card, the stay healthy form, and the new paper, to the SP. When she said nothing about what the SP should do next, he asked 'Where do I go?' Here response was 'Go to wherever they gave you that paper.' She seemed in a hurry to get back to her phone call.   At this point, the SP, reached down to her keyboard, and picked up her pen. She stopped her call, and said to the SP 'You did not ask if you could hold my pen.' The SP responded, 'I'm sorry, I just wanted to borrow the pen to fill out the form.' She responded. Well, you did not ask if you could hold my pen. It's fine, just stand there by the side.'  The SP responded, 'I will give the pen right back to you.'   The SP at this point stepped to the side, filled the form, and returned the pen to the very spot where he had taken it from.   In a moment of confusion, the SP asked 'Where do I go again?' The response came with more than a touch of annoyance. 'Go to wherever you got that paper.'  At this point the SP headed back to 2D  where there was a line of 4 or 5 patients ahead of him. As he arrived at the end of the line, Jerry, the original male nurse, called him out of the line and took him inside to take vital signs.   Jerry, was efficient, friendly, professional, and warm. He asked me to sit outside and said the doctor would be with me soon, since they 'start up again at 1 O'clock.'"		1		1	0	1		This answer pertains to the second clerical assistant who dealt with the SP.

131	12:45	13:10	25	13:55	45	13:56	1	"Upon arriving at 2D as directed, the SP handed his card to a staff person seated on the right hand side of the counter area. The young woman, asked 'How can I help you?' and she did so while leaning back on the chair, with a look and attitude that said that she would rather be anywhere else on the planet but there.     She took the SP's clinic card and when things seemed unusual to her on her computer screen, she leaned back and called for Tanisha (Mcintosh) who was busy with two other staff persons. After three attempts to get Tanisha's attention, a male nurse, named Jerry, approached and offered to help. He took the clinic card from her and walked to the other side of the counter - inside the door - and looked for the patient's information under Dr. Lan's schedule. He informed the SP that his appointment was for this morning. The SP responded that his appointment was for  1:00 pm.   At this point Jerry returned the clinic card to the original staff person and she used 'an old fashioned credit card swiper type of machine' to swipe the card info onto the  stay healthy form. At this time Tanisha came forward and asked if she could help me, but apparently she had already cleared things up with Jerry, so she was pleased to have 'already helped' the SP. This was a nice moment of levity and human interaction.   The original staff person (the one who seemed to not want to be there), then directed the SP to desk 2C for registration.     When the SP arrived at 2C there was only one staff person at that desk, and she was on the phone on what seemed to be a personal call of vital importance. The call must have been important because the staff person, handled the business of three patients who were in line ahead of the SP, without hanging up, and barely speaking to them. There was lots of hand gestures pointing the patients to other desks. When it was the SP's turn, the staff person took his clinic card and stay healthy form, while still on the phone, and did some typing into the computer, printed a piece of paper, and handed the card, the stay healthy form, and the new paper, to the SP. When she said nothing about what the SP should do next, he asked 'Where do I go?' Here response was 'Go to wherever they gave you that paper.' She seemed in a hurry to get back to her phone call.   At this point, the SP, reached down to her keyboard, and picked up her pen. She stopped her call, and said to the SP 'You did not ask if you could hold my pen.' The SP responded, 'I'm sorry, I just wanted to borrow the pen to fill out the form.' She responded. Well, you did not ask if you could hold my pen. It's fine, just stand there by the side.'  The SP responded, 'I will give the pen right back to you.'   The SP at this point stepped to the side, filled the form, and returned the pen to the very spot where he had taken it from.   In a moment of confusion, the SP asked 'Where do I go again?' The response came with more than a touch of annoyance. 'Go to wherever you got that paper.'  At this point the SP headed back to 2D  where there was a line of 4 or 5 patients ahead of him. As he arrived at the end of the line, Jerry, the original male nurse, called him out of the line and took him inside to take vital signs.   Jerry, was efficient, friendly, professional, and warm. He asked me to sit outside and said the doctor would be with me soon, since they 'start up again at 1 O'clock.'"		0		1	0	1		This answer pertains to the second clerical assistant who dealt with the SP.

She let me know that the smoking might be a contributing factor to my heartburn but she was not persuasive with the argument.  "			2

Language was a barrier.  At times he seemed curt but I don't think he really is.  Maybe he was just searching for the right words.  Right after he came back from seeing his attending he starts to talk more about smoking cessation.  It took a while for him to explain that this was also related to the reason I was there in the first place:  heartburn.  Once again, poor eye contact.  Also, many leading questions esp.  in beginning.   Used hardly any ice breaker at start of session.  Warmed up a little toward end."			2
