<h1>How was Your Doctor Visit Today?</h1>
<h4>During medical student's 3 year residency at a Medical Clinic, they are visited by a total of 6 'actor patients' representing various medical cases. Based on the actors experience during their visit, they then give the Doctor and Clinic feedback on various aspects of their visit in the form of comments and grades 0-3 (0 being poor and 3 being excellent). The following visualization compares the difference between the self reported 0-3 scores of the test patients and the results of an AFINN sentiment analysis run over the combined corpus of their comments."</h4>
